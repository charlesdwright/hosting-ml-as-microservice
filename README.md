The Hello World of ML, a simple sentiment analysis algo trained on a library of movie reviews using Python libraries, with a dash of flask and served to-go in a Docker container.

I had this hosted on AWS for a bit to show it off but then they started cancelling social media platforms so I cancelled them.

A work in progress.
